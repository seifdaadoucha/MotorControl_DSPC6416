# MotorControl_DSPC6416

This project contains code to control a DC motor using DSPC6416.

## Description

Please note that the provided code is for illustrative purposes only and serves as a fictional representation. The actual implementation may vary based on your specific hardware setup and the library used for GPIO control.

Ensure that you replace the placeholder functions, such as 'gpio_setup()', 'gpio_set()', and 'gpio_cleanup()', with the appropriate functions provided by your DSPC6416 GPIO library or platform. Additionally, adjust the GPIO pin number and other parameters to match your hardware configuration.

## Instructions

1. Connect the DC motor to the DSPC6416.
2. Compile and load the code to the DSPC6416.
3. The motor will work for 2 seconds and then stop for 2 seconds, repeatedly.
